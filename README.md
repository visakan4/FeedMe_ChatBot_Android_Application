# FeedMe

## Project description

Yelp user reviews and ratings clearly play a major role in determining the fortune of a business as two professors Michael Anderson and Jeremy Magruder from university of California, Berkeley found that “restaurants with a rating improved by just a half a star on a scale of 1 to 5 was much more likely to be full at peak dining times”. However, it gets difficult and time consuming for users to read each review manually and identify the restaurants based on their preference. Furthermore, this leads user to make decision based on star ratings which can be misleading as ratings doesn’t provide the context and features on which a restaurant is rated. 

Feed Me is an Android application that recommends restaurants to users by learning and analyzing the user reviews in
YELP dataset. YELP is an open source dataset containing large number of reviews about the restaurants, the
application mainly aims to assist the users in finding the best restaurant under different categories such as ambienece, discount and deals based on the authentic user reviews through voice commands. We have implemented Sentimental Analysis and Topic modelling to predict the star rating of each restaurants. FeedMe app uses built-in speech recoginition API from Google SDK to attain speech to text capabilities.
